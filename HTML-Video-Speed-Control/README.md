# Video Playback Speed Control and Overlay

## Description

This code adds a semi-transparent black box overlay to a video element, displaying the current playback speed. It also allows users to control the playback speed and skip through the video using keyboard shortcuts.

## Features

* Displays current playback speed in a black box overlay
* Adjusts playback speed using keyboard shortcuts:
    - `d`: Increase speed by 0.25 (maximum 16)
    - `s`: Decrease speed by 0.25 (minimum 0.25)
    - `r`: Reset speed to 1
* Skips video forward/backward by 5 seconds using keyboard shortcuts:
    - `x`: Skip forward
    - `z`: Skip backward

## Installation

1. Include this JavaScript code in your HTML file or project.
2. Ensure you have a video element on your page.

## Usage

1. The code will automatically execute and attach the overlay to the first video element it finds.
2. Use the keyboard shortcuts to control playback speed and skip through the video.

## Customization

*Selector:** Change the `videoElement` selector if your video element has a different class or ID.
* **Overlay Position:** Adjust the `top` and `left` styles of the `boxElement` to position the overlay as desired.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Modify the `handleKeyPress` function to change the assigned keys for playback control and skipping.

## Observations

* The code uses a MutationObserver to ensure it runs even if the video element is added dynamically to the DOM.
